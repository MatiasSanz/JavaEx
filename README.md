## The project contains the first and second exercises. The questions are answered in the Questions file.
### In order to run the project, you need to know that there are two differences between the 1st and 2nd exercises.
### The 1st one runs through the command line on Windows, as requested.  
### Once you have built and compiled the project and go to the CMD on Windows, switch to the folder that contains the Main.java and execute the command:
##  java Main 1 2 33 5 -9 -3 3
### Where the numbers require a blank space betwwen them. The numbers are just a suggestion.

### The second excercise runs after compiling on the terminal inside the developement enviroment you will be using, in my case IntelliJ IDEA
### The command lane asks for the user to enter different words, those need to be one at the same time and the code isnt  case sensitive as shown.
